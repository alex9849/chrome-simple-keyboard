## Chrome Simple Keyboard

This is a virtual keyboard extension for chromium based browsers.
The extension uses native keyboard events and is therefore compatible with modern JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.Js.

The extension is based on [simple-keyboard](https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard).

### Plugin-specific HTML classes

When the following classes are present on the input, the plugin will behave differently.

- `no-keyboard` - do not pop up the keyboard when the input is focused. Instead, a button is shown to open the keyboard manually.
- `no-keyboard-no-toggler` - do not pop up the keyboard nor button when the input is focused.
